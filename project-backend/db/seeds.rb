Recipe.create(name: "Skillet-Roasted Chicken and Potatoes", course: "main", ingredients: ["4 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2½ cups buttermilk, shaken", "Good olive oil", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon dry white wine, such as Chablis", "1½ teaspoons fresh thyme leaves", "¹⁄₈ teaspoon sweet Hungarian paprika", "1 pound medium Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled, sliced ¼ inch thick", "1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives"], time: 315, steps: "At least 4 hours (but not more than 12 hours) before you plan to serve, sprinkle the chicken all over with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Place in a 1-gallon sealable plastic bag and pour in the buttermilk. Seal the bag and massage it lightly to be sure the chicken is coated with the buttermilk. Place in the refrigerator to marinate.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil in an unheated 12-inch cast-iron skillet and tilt the pan so the oil covers the bottom. Lift the thighs out of the buttermilk, letting any excess buttermilk drip off, and place them in the skillet, skin side up, in one layer. Discard the marinade. In a small bowl, combine the mustard and wine and brush it on the top of the chicken. Sprinkle with the thyme, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Place the skillet in the oven and roast the chicken for 30 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a plate and put the potatoes, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper into the skillet. Toss to coat with the pan juices then spread the potatoes out. Return the chicken to the skillet, placing it on the potatoes. Roast 30 minutes longer, until the chicken registers 155 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer just the chicken to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Return the skillet to the oven, raise the temperature to 425 degrees, and roast the potatoes for 15 minutes, until they’re tender and starting to brown. Return the chicken to the pan and sprinkle with the parsley, chives, and extra salt. Serve hot from the skillet.", skill_level: "beginner")

Recipe.create(name: "Apple Crostata", course: "dessert", ingredients: ["2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup granulated or superfine sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 pound very cold unsalted butter, diced", "1-1/2 pounds McIntosh, Macoun, or Empire apples", "1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup granulated or superfine sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/8 teaspoon ground allspice", "4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (1/2 stick), diced"], time: 85, steps: "For the pastry, place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and toss quickly with your fingers to coat each cube of butter with the flour. Pulse 12 to 15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the 1/4 cup ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button to combine, but stop the machine just before the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and form into 2 disks. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate one of the disks for at least an hour. Freeze the rest of the pastry.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Roll the pastry into an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

For the filling, peel, core, and quarter the apples. Cut each quarter into 3 chunks. Toss the chunks with the orange zest. Cover the tart dough with the apple chunks, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border.

Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Pour into a bowl and rub it with your fingers until it starts holding together. Sprinkle evenly on the apples. Gently fold the border over the apples, pleating it to make a circle.

Bake the crostata for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the apples are tender. Let the tart cool for 5 minutes, then use 2 large spatulas to transfer it to a wire rack.", skill_level: "advanced")

Recipe.create(name: "Roasted Broccolini & Cheddar", course: "side", ingredients: ["1½ pounds broccolini", "Good olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 ounces good sharp aged white Cheddar, such as Cabot", "Juice of ½ lemon"], time: 20, steps: "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Remove and discard the bottom half of the broccolini stems. Cut the remaining broccolini stems in half or quarters lengthwise, depending on the size of the stems. Don’t cut the florets—just pull them apart. Place the broccolini on a sheet pan. Drizzle 4 tablespoons olive oil on the broccolini and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Toss well, making sure the broccolini is lightly coated with oil. Spread the broccolini in one layer and roast for 10 minutes, tossing once with a metal spatula, until crisp-tender.

Meanwhile, slice the Cheddar ¼ inch thick and break it into large crumbles. When the broccolini is ready, sprinkle the cheese on the broccolini and return to the oven for 3 to 4 minutes, just until the cheese melts. Squeeze on the lemon juice, taste for seasonings, and serve hot.", skill_level: "beginner")
